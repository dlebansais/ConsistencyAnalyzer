## Cause

A statement or declaration is not indented as it should be, compared to other statements and declaration in the program.

## Rule description

Statements and declaration are indented to make the source code more readable. Indentation represents the depth level of a construct in the program, and should match it.    

For example, members of a class beloging to a namespace declared in a source file are indented twice.
 
````csharp
namespace ConsistencAnalyzer
{
    class CodeFixes
    {
	    public object AnalyzerTest1;
    }
}
````

A wrong indentatation can look like this:
 
````csharp
namespace ConsistencAnalyzer
{
    class CodeFixes
    {
	    public object AnalyzerTest1;
	        public object AnalyzerTest2;
    }
}
````

In the example above, `AnalyzerTest2` violates the rule, because it's indented too much.

Another source of bad indentation is mixing space and tab character. Only or or the other should be used, and if space is used the number of whitespace representing one level of indentation should be the same everywhere.
 
## How to fix violations

Change `AnalyzerTest2` indentation to be similar to `AnalyzerTest1`, and use either tab or space characters everywhere in the same amount.  

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to replace the bad indentation with the right one.
