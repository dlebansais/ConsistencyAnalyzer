Title | Start and end regions at the same block level  
Id | ConA1708
Category | Region Rules

## Cause

A region is started within a block but ended in a different block. This should be avoided, the beginning and end of a region should be within the same block.

## Rule description

Say you have code with nested blocks (either statement, or declaration). A region can start in a block, and end in one of the nested blocks. Or it can start in a nested block and end in an outer block. The code below demonstrates these two situations:
 
````csharp
public class Math
{
    #region Test
    public double abs(double value)
    {
        if (value >= 0)
        {
    #endregion
            return value;
        }
        else
        {
            return -1 * value;
        }
    }
}
````
or 
````csharp
public class Math
{
    public double abs(double value)
    {
        if (value >= 0)
        {
    #region Test
            return value;
        }
        else
        {
            return -1 * value;
        }
    }
    #endregion
}
````

This program in either version violates the rule because the `#region Test` and `#endregion` are not at the same block level.   

The code below show two possible fixes:

````csharp
public class Math
{
    #region Test
    public double abs(double value)
    {
        if (value >= 0)
        {
            return value;
        }
        else
        {
            return -1 * value;
        }
    }
    #endregion
}
````
or 
````csharp
public class Math
{
    public double abs(double value)
    {
        if (value >= 0)
        {
    #region Test
            return value;
    #endregion
        }
        else
        {
            return -1 * value;
        }
    }
}
````
 
## How to fix violations

Move either the `#region Test` or `#endregion` lines to ensure they are at the same block level. 

## Code fixes

This rule has no associated code fix suggestion.
