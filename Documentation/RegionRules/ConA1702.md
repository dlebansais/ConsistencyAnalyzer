# ConA1702

Rule | &nbsp;
------------ | -------------
Title | Public member outside the expected region
Id | ConA1702
Category | Region Rules

## Cause

A class has regions containing public members, and the program is following the [accessibility (simple)](RegionGroupingModes.md) region grouping mode, but there is a public class member outside that region.

## Rule description

In a program regions can be recognized as following a grouping mode, and the accessibility mode in particular. When a class has some of its public members in a region, and some outside, those outside the region violate the rule.
 
````csharp
public class Test
{
    #region Public
    public Test()
    {
    }
    #endregion

    #region Protected
    /*...*/

    public void SomeMethod()
    {
    }
    #endregion

    public void SomeOtherMethod()
    {
    }
}
````

In the example above, both `SomeMethod` and `SomeOtherMethod` violate the rule. The first region with public members, `#region Public` is expected to contain all of them.

## How to fix violations

Move all public members inside the same regions, as follow:
 
````csharp
public class Test
{
    #region Public
    public Test()
    {
    }

    public void SomeMethod()
    {
    }

    public void SomeOtherMethod()
    {
    }
    #endregion

    #region Protected
    /*...*/
    #endregion
}
````
