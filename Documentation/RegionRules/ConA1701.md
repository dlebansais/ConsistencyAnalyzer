Title | Do not use nested regions
Id | ConA1701
Category | Region Rules

## Cause

A class has regions within regions. This should be avoided, there are other and better ways to keep the code structured.

## Rule description

One can have regions nested within regions, typically in classes with a lot of code.
 
````csharp
public class TextEditor
{
    #region Properties
    #region Color Properties
    /*...*/
    #endregion
    #region Caret Properties
    /*...*/
    #endregion
    #region Font Properties
    /*...*/
    #endregion
    #endregion

    #region Events
    #region Color Events
    /*...*/
    #endregion
    #region Caret Events
    /*...*/
    #endregion
    #region Font Events
    /*...*/
    #endregion
    #endregion

    /*...*/
}
````

This program violates the rule because the `Color Properties` region is nested within the `Properties` region.  

Instead, refactor the class in a hierarchy of classes, or make the class partial to split the code in multiple files:

````csharp
// TextEditor.Properties.cs
public partial class TextEditor
{
    #region Color Properties
    /*...*/
    #endregion
    #region Caret Properties
    /*...*/
    #endregion
    #region Font Properties
    /*...*/
    #endregion
}
````
and
````csharp
// TextEditor.Events.cs
public partial class TextEditor
{
    #region Color Events
    /*...*/
    #endregion
    #region Caret Events
    /*...*/
    #endregion
    #region Font Events
    /*...*/
    #endregion
}
````
 
## How to fix violations

Remove regions within regions.

## Code fixes

The suggested fix will remove the nested region.
