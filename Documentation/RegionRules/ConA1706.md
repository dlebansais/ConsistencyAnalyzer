# ConA1706

Rule | &nbsp;
------------ | -------------
Title | Public method outside the expected region
Id | ConA1706
Category | Region Rules

## Cause

A class has a region containing public methods, and the program is following the [accessibility (full)](RegionGroupingModes.md) region grouping mode, but there is a public method outside that region.

## Rule description

In a program regions can be recognized as following a grouping mode, and the accessibility mode in its full version in particular. When a class has some of its public methods in a region, and some outside, those outside the region violate the rule.
 
````csharp
public class Test
{
    #region Methods
    public void Test1()
{
}
    #endregion

    #region Other
    public void Test2()
{
}
    #endregion
}
````

In the example above, `Test2` violates the rule. The first region with public methods, `#region Methods` is expected to contain all of them.

## How to fix violations

Move all public methods inside the same regions, as follow:
 
````csharp
public class Test
{
    #region Methods
    public void Test1()
{
}

    public void Test2()
{
}
    #endregion
}
````

## Code fixes

This rule has no associated code fix suggestion.
