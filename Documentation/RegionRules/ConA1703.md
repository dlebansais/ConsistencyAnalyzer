# ConA1703

Rule | &nbsp;
------------ | -------------
Title | Protected member outside the expected region
Id | ConA1703
Category | Region Rules

## Cause

A class has regions containing protected members, and the program is following the [accessibility (simple)](RegionGroupingModes.md) region grouping mode, but there is a protected class member outside that region.

## Rule description

In a program regions can be recognized as following a grouping mode, and the accessibility mode in particular. When a class has some of its protected members in a region, and some outside, those outside the region violate the rule.
 
````csharp
public class Test
{
    #region Protected
    protected Test()
    {
    }
    #endregion

    #region Public
    /*...*/

    protected void SomeMethod()
    {
    }
    #endregion

    protected void SomeOtherMethod()
    {
    }
}
````

In the example above, both `SomeMethod` and `SomeOtherMethod` violate the rule. The first region with protected members, `#region Protected` is expected to contain all of them.

## How to fix violations

Move all protected members inside the same regions, as follow:
 
````csharp
public class Test
{
    #region Protected
    protected Test()
    {
    }

    protected void SomeMethod()
    {
    }

    protected void SomeOtherMethod()
    {
    }
    #endregion

    #region Public
    /*...*/
    #endregion
}
````
