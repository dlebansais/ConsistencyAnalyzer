Name | Use regions for all class code or not at all
Id | ConA1700
Category | Region Rules

## Cause

A class is using at least one region, and its regions cover the entire content of the class, while another class is using also using at least one region but some of its code isn't within a region.

## Rule description

This rule assumes that if regions are used in a class in such a was that all code is within a region, then the intent is to have the same for all classes. For instance, let's have:
 
````csharp
public class Animal
{
    #region Init
    public Animal(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }
    #endregion

    #region Properties
    public string Name { get; init; }
    #endregion
}
````
and
````csharp
public class Dog : Animal
{
    #region Init
    public Dog(string name, string ownerName)
        : base(name)
    {
        OwnerName = ownerName;
    }
    #endregion

    public string OwnerName { get; init; }
}
````

This program violates the rule until the `OwnerName` property is also included into a region. 

## How to fix violations

Add regions in classes that miss them, or remove regions altogether.

## Code fixes

This rule has no associated code fix suggestion.
