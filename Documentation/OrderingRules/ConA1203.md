Title | System using directives must appear in a consistent order
Id | ConA1203
Category | Ordering Rules

## Cause

A using directive which declares a member of the *System* namespace appears after, or before, a using directive which declares a member of a different namespace, but not in the same order as in other classes.

## Rule description

Using directives can be ordered in alphabetical order, but it is sometimes preferred to declare using directives for the *System* namespace first, and then directives for other namespaces. When a majority of C# classes use this order, and a using directive for the *System* namespace appears after a using directive for another namespace, this result in a violation of the rule.

For instance, consider this code:
 
````csharp
namespace Components
{
    using AnalyzerTest;
    using System.Thread;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using ConsistencAnalyzer;
    using CodeFixes;

    /* ... */
}
````

In the example above, `using AnalyzerTest;` violates the rule, because it doesn't appear the `using System.Collections.Generic;`.

## How to fix violations

Move `using AnalyzerTest;` in the `Components` namespace to appear after the `using System.Collections.Generic;` directive: 
 
````csharp
namespace Components
{
    using System.Thread;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using AnalyzerTest;
    using ConsistencAnalyzer;
    using CodeFixes;

    /* ... */
}
````

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to move using directives after the last using directive for the *System* namespace.
