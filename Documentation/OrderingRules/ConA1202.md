Title | Elements must appear in a consistent order
Id | ConA1202
Category | Ordering Rules

## Cause

An element in a class appears after, or before, elements of other types, but not in the same order as in other classes.

## Rule description

In C#, elements such as fields, properties or methods can appear in any order in a class. However, if a majority of classes in the program use the same order, this order is enforced for all classes.    

Say that properties always appear before fields like in the class below:
 
````csharp
class Component1
{
    public object ConsistencAnalyzer { get; set; }
	public object CodeFixes { get; set; }
	public object AnalyzerTest1;
}
````

And now say we have this new class:
 
````csharp
class Component2
{
	public object AnalyzerTest2;
    public object ConsistencAnalyzer { get; set; }
	public object CodeFixes { get; set; }
}
````

In the example above, `AnalyzerTest2` violates the rule, because it doesn't appear after properties.

## How to fix violations

Move `AnalyzerTest2` in the `Component2` class to appear after the `ConsistencAnalyzer` and `CodeFixes` properties. 

## Code fixes

This rule has no associated code fix suggestion.
