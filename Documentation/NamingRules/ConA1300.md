Title | Namespace names must be consistent
Id | ConA1300
Category | Naming Rules

## Cause

Namespaces in the program are following one of the [naming schemes](NamingSchemes.md), and a namespace is not compliant with this scheme.  

## Rule description

In a program, namespaces can be recognized as following a naming scheme. When a namespace is not compliant with this scheme, it must be changed to make it compliant with the way other namespaces are named.
 
````csharp
namespace ConsistencyAnalyzer
{
    /*...*/
}

namespace CodeFixes
{
    /*...*/
}

namespace analyzerTest
{
    /*...*/
}
````

In the example above, `analyzerTest` violates the rule, because it doesn't begin with an upper case letter. All namespaces are expected to begin with either a lower case or an upper case letter, and namespaces that begin with an upper case letter outnumber those that begin with a lower case letter.

## How to fix violations

Change the namespace name to `AnalyzerTest`, or `ConsistencyAnalyzer` and `CodeFixes` to `consistencyAnalyzer` and `codeFixes` respectively. 

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to change the namespace name to a compliant name.
