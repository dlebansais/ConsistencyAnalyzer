Title | Local variable names must be consistent
Id | ConA1314
Category | Naming Rules

## Cause

Local variables in the program are following one of the [naming schemes](NamingSchemes.md), and a variable name is not compliant with this scheme.  

## Rule description

In a program, local variables can be recognized as following a naming scheme. When a local variable is not compliant with this scheme, it must be changed to make it compliant with the way other variables are named.
 
````csharp
namespace Analyzer
{
    class Test
    {
        public Test()
        {
            int ConsistencyAnalyzer;
            int CodeFixes;
            int analyzerTest;

            /* ... */
        }
    }
}
````

In the example above, `analyzerTest` violates the rule, because it doesn't begin with an upper case letter. All local variables are expected to begin with either a lower case or an upper case letter, and variables that begin with an upper case letter outnumber those that begin with a lower case letter.

## How to fix violations

Change the local variable name to `AnalyzerTest`, or `ConsistencyAnalyzer` and `CodeFixes` to `consistencyAnalyzer` and `codeFixes` respectively. 

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to change the local variable name to a compliant name.
