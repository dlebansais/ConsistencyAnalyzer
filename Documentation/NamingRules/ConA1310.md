Title | Properties names must be consistent
Id | ConA1310
Category | Naming Rules

## Cause

Properties in the program are following one of the [naming schemes](NamingSchemes.md), and a property name is not compliant with this scheme.  

## Rule description

In a program, properties can be recognized as following a naming scheme. When a property is not compliant with this scheme, it must be changed to make it compliant with the way other properties are named.
 
````csharp
namespace Analyzer
{
    class Test
    {
        public int ConsistencyAnalyzer { get; set; }
        public int CodeFixes { get; set; }
        public int analyzerTest { get; set; }
    }
}
````

In the example above, `analyzerTest` violates the rule, because it doesn't begin with an upper case letter. All properties are expected to begin with either a lower case or an upper case letter, and properties that begin with an upper case letter outnumber those that begin with a lower case letter.

## How to fix violations

Change the property name to `AnalyzerTest`, or `ConsistencyAnalyzer` and `CodeFixes` to `consistencyAnalyzer` and `codeFixes` respectively. 

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to change the property name to a compliant name.
