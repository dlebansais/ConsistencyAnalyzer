Rule | &nbsp;
------------ | -------------
Title | Enum member names must be consistent
Id | ConA1306
Category | Naming Rules

## Cause

Enum members in the program are following one of the [naming schemes](NamingSchemes.md), and an enum member name is not compliant with this scheme.  

## Rule description

In a program, enum members can be recognized as following a naming scheme. When an enum member is not compliant with this scheme, it must be changed to make it compliant with the way other enum members are named.
 
````csharp
enum Components
{
    ConsistencAnalyzer,
	CodeFixes,
	analyzerTest,
}
````

In the example above, `analyzerTest` violates the rule, because it doesn't begin with an upper case letter. All enum members are expected to begin with either a lower case or an upper case letter, and members that begin with an upper case letter outnumber those that begin with a lower case letter.

## How to fix violations

Change the enum member name to `AnalyzerTest`, or `ConsistencyAnalyzer` and `CodeFixes` to `consistencyAnalyzer` and `codeFixes` respectively. 

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to change the enum member name to a compliant name.
