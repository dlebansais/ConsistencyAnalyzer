------------ | -------------
Title | Parameter names must be consistent
Id | ConA1312
Category | Naming Rules

## Cause

Parameters in the program are following one of the [naming schemes](NamingSchemes.md), and a parameter name is not compliant with this scheme.  

## Rule description

In a program, method parameters can be recognized as following a naming scheme. When a parameter is not compliant with this scheme, it must be changed to make it compliant with the way other parameters are named.
 
````csharp
namespace Analyzer
{
    class Test
    {
        public Test(int ConsistencyAnalyzer, int CodeFixes, int analyzerTest)
        {
        }
    }
}
````

In the example above, `analyzerTest` violates the rule, because it doesn't begin with an upper case letter. All parameters are expected to begin with either a lower case or an upper case letter, and parameters that begin with an upper case letter outnumber those that begin with a lower case letter.

## How to fix violations

Change the parameter name to `AnalyzerTest`, or `ConsistencyAnalyzer` and `CodeFixes` to `consistencyAnalyzer` and `codeFixes` respectively. 

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to change the parameter name to a compliant name.
