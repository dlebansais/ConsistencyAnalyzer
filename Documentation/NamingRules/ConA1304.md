------------ | -------------
Title | Enum names must be consistent
Id | ConA1304
Category | Naming Rules

## Cause

Enums in the program are following one of the [naming schemes](NamingSchemes.md), and an enum name is not compliant with this scheme.  

## Rule description

In a program, enums can be recognized as following a naming scheme. When an enum is not compliant with this scheme, it must be changed to make it compliant with the way other enums are named.
 
````csharp
enum ConsistencyAnalyzer
{
    /*...*/
}

enum CodeFixes
{
    /*...*/
}

enum analyzerTest
{
    /*...*/
}
````

In the example above, `analyzerTest` violates the rule, because it doesn't begin with an upper case letter. All enums are expected to begin with either a lower case or an upper case letter, and enums that begin with an upper case letter outnumber those that begin with a lower case letter.

## How to fix violations

Change the enum name to `AnalyzerTest`, or `ConsistencyAnalyzer` and `CodeFixes` to `consistencyAnalyzer` and `codeFixes` respectively. 

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to change the enum name to a compliant name.
