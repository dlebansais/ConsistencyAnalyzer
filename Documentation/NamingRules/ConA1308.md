Title | Events names must be consistent
Id | ConA1308
Category | Naming Rules

## Cause

Events in the program are following one of the [naming schemes](NamingSchemes.md), and an event name is not compliant with this scheme.  

## Rule description

In a program, events can be recognized as following a naming scheme. When an event is not compliant with this scheme, it must be changed to make it compliant with the way other events are named.
 
````csharp
namespace Analyzer
{
	class Test
    {
        public event System.EventHandler Analyzed;
        public event System.EventHandler Fixed;
        public event System.EventHandler tested;
    }
}
````

In the example above, `tested` violates the rule, because it doesn't begin with an upper case letter. All events are expected to begin with either a lower case or an upper case letter, and events that begin with an upper case letter outnumber those that begin with a lower case letter.

## How to fix violations

Change the event name to `Tested`, or `Analyzed` and `Fixed` to `analyzed` and `fixed` respectively. 

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to change the event name to a compliant name.
