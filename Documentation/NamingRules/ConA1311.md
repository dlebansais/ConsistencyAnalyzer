Title | Methods names must be consistent
Id | ConA1311
Category | Naming Rules

## Cause

Methods in the program are following one of the [naming schemes](NamingSchemes.md), and a method name is not compliant with this scheme.  

## Rule description

In a program, methods can be recognized as following a naming scheme. When a method is not compliant with this scheme, it must be changed to make it compliant with the way other methods are named.
 
````csharp
namespace Analyzer
{
    class Test
    {
        public void ConsistencyAnalyzer()
        {
        }

        public void CodeFixes()
        {
        }

        public void analyzerTest()
        {
        }
    }
}
````

In the example above, `analyzerTest` violates the rule, because it doesn't begin with an upper case letter. All methods are expected to begin with either a lower case or an upper case letter, and methods that begin with an upper case letter outnumber those that begin with a lower case letter.

## How to fix violations

Change the method name to `AnalyzerTest`, or `ConsistencyAnalyzer` and `CodeFixes` to `consistencyAnalyzer` and `codeFixes` respectively. 

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to change the method name to a compliant name.
