------------ | -------------
Title | Record names must be consistent
Id | ConA1302
Category | Naming Rules

## Cause

Records in the program are following one of the [naming schemes](NamingSchemes.md), and a record name is not compliant with this scheme.  

## Rule description

In a program, records can be recognized as following a naming scheme. When a record is not compliant with this scheme, it must be changed to make it compliant with the way other records are named.
 
````csharp
record ConsistencyAnalyzer
{
    /*...*/
}

record CodeFixes
{
    /*...*/
}

record analyzerTest
{
    /*...*/
}
````

In the example above, `analyzerTest` violates the rule, because it doesn't begin with an upper case letter. All records are expected to begin with either a lower case or an upper case letter, and records that begin with an upper case letter outnumber those that begin with a lower case letter.

## How to fix violations

Change the record name to `AnalyzerTest`, or `ConsistencyAnalyzer` and `CodeFixes` to `consistencyAnalyzer` and `codeFixes` respectively. 

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to change the record name to a compliant name.
