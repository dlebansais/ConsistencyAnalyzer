Title | Interface names must be consistent
Id | ConA1305
Category | Naming Rules

## Cause

Interfaces in the program are following one of the [naming schemes](NamingSchemes.md), and an interface name is not compliant with this scheme.  

## Rule description

In a program, interfaces can be recognized as following a naming scheme. When an interface is not compliant with this scheme, it must be changed to make it compliant with the way other interfaces are named.
 
````csharp
interface IConsistencyAnalyzer
{
    /*...*/
}

interface ICodeFixes
{
    /*...*/
}

interface IanalyzerTest
{
    /*...*/
}
````

In the example above, `IanalyzerTest` violates the rule, because the `I` prefix isn't followed by an upper case letter. All interfaces are expected to begin with either a lower case or an upper case letter after this prefix, and interfaces that begin with an upper case letter outnumber those that begin with a lower case letter.

Note that the `I` prefix is optional. If interface names without it outnumber interface names with it, it is interface names with the prefix that may violate the rule.

## How to fix violations

Change the interface name to `IAnalyzerTest`, or `IConsistencyAnalyzer` and `ICodeFixes` to `IconsistencyAnalyzer` and `IcodeFixes` respectively. 

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to change the interface name to a compliant name.
