Title | Class names must be consistent
Id | ConA1301
Category | Naming Rules

## Cause

Classes in the program are following one of the [naming schemes](NamingSchemes.md), and a class name is not compliant with this scheme.  

## Rule description

In a program, classes can be recognized as following a naming scheme. When a class is not compliant with this scheme, it must be changed to make it compliant with the way other classes are named.
 
````csharp
class ConsistencyAnalyzer
{
    /*...*/
}

class CodeFixes
{
    /*...*/
}

class analyzerTest
{
    /*...*/
}
````

In the example above, `analyzerTest` violates the rule, because it doesn't begin with an upper case letter. All classes are expected to begin with either a lower case or an upper case letter, and classes that begin with an upper case letter outnumber those that begin with a lower case letter.

## How to fix violations

Change the class name to `AnalyzerTest`, or `ConsistencyAnalyzer` and `CodeFixes` to `consistencyAnalyzer` and `codeFixes` respectively. 

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to change the class name to a compliant name.
