Rule | &nbsp;
------------ | -------------
Title | Type parameter names must be consistent
Id | ConA1313
Category | Naming Rules

## Cause

Type parameters in the program are following one of the [naming schemes](NamingSchemes.md), and a type parameter name is not compliant with this scheme.  

## Rule description

In a program, type parameters can be recognized as following a naming scheme. When a type parameter is not compliant with this scheme, it must be changed to make it compliant with the way other parameters are named.
 
````csharp
namespace Analyzer
{
    class Test<ConsistencyAnalyzer, CodeFixes, analyzerTest>
    {
    }
}
````

In the example above, `analyzerTest` violates the rule, because it doesn't begin with an upper case letter. All type parameters are expected to begin with either a lower case or an upper case letter, and parameters that begin with an upper case letter outnumber those that begin with a lower case letter.

## How to fix violations

Change the type parameter name to `AnalyzerTest`, or `ConsistencyAnalyzer` and `CodeFixes` to `consistencyAnalyzer` and `codeFixes` respectively. 

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to change the type parameter name to a compliant name.
