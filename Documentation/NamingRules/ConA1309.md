Title | Fields names must be consistent
Id | ConA1309
Category | Naming Rules

## Cause

Fields in the program are following one of the [naming schemes](NamingSchemes.md), and a field name is not compliant with this scheme.  

## Rule description

In a program, fields can be recognized as following a naming scheme. When a field is not compliant with this scheme, it must be changed to make it compliant with the way other fields are named.
 
````csharp
namespace Analyzer
{
    class Test
    {
        public int ConsistencyAnalyzer;
        public int CodeFixes;
        public int analyzerTest;
    }
}
````

In the example above, `analyzerTest` violates the rule, because it doesn't begin with an upper case letter. All fields are expected to begin with either a lower case or an upper case letter, and fields that begin with an upper case letter outnumber those that begin with a lower case letter.

## How to fix violations

Change the field name to `AnalyzerTest`, or `ConsistencyAnalyzer` and `CodeFixes` to `consistencyAnalyzer` and `codeFixes` respectively. 

## Code fixes

The suggested fix is to change the field name to a compliant name.
